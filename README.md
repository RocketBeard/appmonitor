# appmonitor

Local application to monitor time spent in a given application on a daily basis.

Current time can be seen in the MacOS menu bar alongside the name of the application.

The log resets each day and outputs the total time spent for the day in the specified log file.

The application only monitors apps in focus so will only track active time spent.
